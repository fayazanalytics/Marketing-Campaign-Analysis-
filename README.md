# Marketing Campaign Analysis Using SQL

# Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a company's marketing campaign data using SQL to gain insights into customer transactions, sales trends, and campaign effectiveness. The project involves several SQL queries aimed at understanding key aspects of the company's operations, such as product categories, customer purchasing behavior, and campaign success rates. The goal is to provide actionable insights for business growth and marketing strategy improvements.
